'''In this exercise you will take the logic exercises you memorized
and start trying them out in Python.
Take each of these logic problems and write what you think the answer will be.
In each case it will be either True or False.
Once you have the answers written down, you will start
Python in your Terminal and type each logic problem in to confirm your answers.

# version 1, taking over 100 lines, this is definitely not the best
# my goal will be to simplify this code into fewer lines and also write a
# program to check my answers
